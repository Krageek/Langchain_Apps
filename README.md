Summarizer App with Langchain and OpenAI

This app is meant to be able to summarize text into a very understandable form while also having the ability to translate the summary into different languages.
There is also the added functionality of using text-to-speech for some of the langugaes for an audio version of the summary.

This app was built in Python using LangChain and OpenAI's API for the summarization. For the translation, deep-translator was used, while gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) was used for the text-to-speech component.
The app was deployed using Streamlit.
